  Perplexity has done such a good job with UI and User interactions that, every other app i see, even from Big4 are just using same interactions - that's what you call a good design.<br>
  Let alone interactions, even MetaAIs home page is straight up copied from pplx.

  I am so ready to pay good amount of money for samdish interviewing any of Amit shah, Yogi or PM modi.<br>
  He takes guests to a comfort level where the cameras become secondary. His yograj interview from this week is so fuckin unhinged - more of that with one of the policy makers. https://t.co/weyrPeEfiG
