## Books {#books}
### **The Obesity Code** by Dr. Jason Fung  
_This book was a real eye-opener for me. It clearly explains how our bodies work, what really causes weight gain, and the type of 'weight gain' we should actually be concerned about. This book makes a compelling case for intermittent fasting as a way to build a healthier lifestyle and even help undo past 'sins.' Highly recommended if you want to understand your body better._

### **Factfulness** by Hans Rosling  
_This book is all about challenging the common biases we have about the world. It uses facts and data to confront our instinctiveâ€”and often wrongâ€”assumptions on topics like poverty, population, and education. It's a must-read if you want to understand what's really happening on our planet. Its very tempting to call it a 'Book of Hope,' but it's really a 'Book of Reality.'_

### **The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning** by Josh Starmer  
_Imagine someone took statistics, blended it with dad jokes and children's dinosaur comics, and created this absolute gem. If you've ever wanted to dive into machine learning but felt intimidated, this is the book for you. It's hands-down the most approachable and fun way to learn. P.S. I'm a huge fan and even have a signed copy from the author, Josh Starmer!_

### **Why I Switched to Black Coffee**  
_My simple rule for the last 7-8 months has been just black coffee. No sugar, no milk, no cream. For me, it's a sustainable way to support liver health while still getting that morning 'kick'. If you want to give it a shot, try easing into it: start with one sugar for a week, then half, and by week three, you'll be used to none. Your liver will thank you for it. And if you're sensitive to caffeine, decaf is your friendâ€”I drink it all the time._

### **CREATINE, creatine & CrEaTiNe**  
_I started taking 3g of creatine about 6 weeks agoâ€”after doing a ton of research, of courseâ€”and my only thought is, "Why didn't I start sooner?" My workout intensity is up by a good 15-20%, and I feel like I recover way faster. I've noticed more muscle definition too, which I think is mostly because I can push myself harder. Definitely talk to a nutritionist to see if it's right for you, but I can't recommend looking into it enough._
