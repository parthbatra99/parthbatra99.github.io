## Books {#books}
**The Obesity Code** by Dr. Jason Fung  
_This book was a real eye-opener for me. It clearly explains how our bodies work, what really causes weight gain, and the type of 'weight gain' we should actually be concerned about. Dr. Fung makes a compelling case for intermittent fasting as a way to build a healthier lifestyle and even help undo past 'sins.' Highly recommended if you want to understand your body better._

## Lifestyle Habits {#lifestyle-habits}
**Just have Black Coffee**  
_My simple rule for the last 7-8 months has been just black coffee. No sugar, no milk, no cream. For me, it's a sustainable way to support liver health while still getting that morning 'kick'. If you want to give it a shot, try easing into it: start with one sugar for a week, then half, and by week three, you'll be used to none. Your liver will thank you for it. And if you're sensitive to caffeine, decaf is your friendâ€”I drink it all the time._
