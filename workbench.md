title: Workbench
description: Welcome to my digital garageâ€”where I tinker with code, break things (mostly in production), and occasionally build something worth bragging about. From ML pipelines that actually work to weekend projects that keep me up at 3 AM, this is my collection of builds that survived the "it works on my machine" phase. Think of it as my highlight reel, but with more Git commits and fewer filters.
