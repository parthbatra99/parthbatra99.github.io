_This list is intentionally incomplete. The journey of collecting these dreams is as important as achieving them._

#### Reflections so far
What started as a simple bucket list experiement has evolved into my life's blueprint. The completed goals have taught me that the journey often yields more than the destination.
With each achievement, I've realized that the true value isn't in ticking boxes but in the growth that comes from pursuing these dreams.

_"Life is like cricket - sometimes you need to defend, sometimes you need to attack, but you must always keep your wicket intact."_
